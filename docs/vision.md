# Nuewframe Vision

Nuewframe is a NuewLabs Inc. open-source initiative that delivers a cohesive toolkit—libraries, CLIs, and shared practices—for building reliable automation. Each component (including this `timeout` CLI) follows the same principles:

1. **Cross-platform first** – Linux, macOS, and Windows receive equal treatment.
2. **Operator experience** – Human-readable errors, minimal dependencies, and predictable exit codes.
3. **Security posture** – Documented disclosure process, CI that enforces clippy/fmt/tests, and regular audits.
4. **Composable building blocks** – Crates and tools are designed to work alone or together.

Future Nuewframe releases will reuse this repo’s contribution guidelines and workflows. Contributions to any Nuewframe project should respect the standards captured in `CONTRIBUTING.md` plus this vision document.
