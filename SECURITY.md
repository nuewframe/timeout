# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| main    | ✅        |
| tagged releases | ✅ (latest minor only) |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- [Open a new security issue](https://github.com/nuewframe/timeout/issues/new?template=security.md&title=Security%20Report%3A%20) on GitHub. The template will prompt for reproduction steps, affected versions, and mitigations.
- Set the issue visibility to private when prompted; only maintainers will be able to view it until disclosure.
- We aim to acknowledge within **3 business days** and provide a mitigation or patch ETA within **10 business days**.
- Reporters are credited in the release notes unless they request anonymity.

## Disclosure Process
1. We validate the report and create an internal tracking issue.
2. Fixes ship to `main`, then to a tagged release.
3. We coordinate publication (CVE if applicable) with the reporter and communicate timelines.
